A native Texan, I fell in love with programming in high school, and made it a
career in adulthood.

Currently, I get paid to write [Swift] and (begrudgingly) [Objective-C] for
[thoughtbot].

In my spare time, I like to play around with [Haskell] because talking about
monads makes me sound smarter than I actually am.

I'm traveling the country right now, spending a month in various US cities
before settling in Austin, TX. I'm currently living in Portland.

I root for the [Houston Astros][astros], and lift weights at whatever CrossFit
gym is closest to my Airbnb.
