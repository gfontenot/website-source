A native Texan, I fell in love with programming in high school, and made it a
career in adulthood.

Currently, I get paid to write [Swift] and (begrudgingly) [Objective-C] for
[thoughtbot].

In my spare time, I like to play around with [Haskell] because talking about
monads makes me sound smarter than I actually am.

I'm currently living in Austin TX, after spending a decade living in the
frigid North East (specifically Boston).

I root for the [Houston Astros][astros], and lift weights at [CrossFit South
Lamar][cf-sola]
