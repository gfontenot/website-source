Hey there! My name is Gordon Fontenot, and I'm a software developer living in
Austin, Texas.

I'm currently working at [thoughtbot], where I serve as the Mobile Development
Director. This is a fancy-sounding title that means I write a bunch of iOS
apps and manage thoughtbot's distributed mobile team.

At work I write a lot of [Swift], and occasionally some [Objective-C]. I've
also been enjoying [React Native] recently, and have spent a bunch of time
exploring [Phoenix] and [Elixir] for web development.

[Phoenix]: http://www.phoenixframework.org/
[Elixir]: http://elixir-lang.org/

In my spare time, I like to play around with [Haskell] because talking about
monads makes me sound smarter than I actually am. [This
website][website-source], in fact, is generated using [Hakyll], which is a
static site generator written in Haskell.

I've been fairly involved with the iOS open source community over the years.
Most notably, I'm a core maintainer for [Argo], a functional JSON parser for
Swift that was heavily influenced by [Aeson] in Haskell and was itself the
inspiration for a number of libraries in the Swift JSON parsing space. I'm
also pretty proud of [Runes], [Curry], and [Swish].

I also try to do my personal work in the open when I can. One of my pet
projects is [my personal microblog][microblog], which is written in Haskell
using Yesod. I have also been working on [reflow], a Haskell tool for
reflowing plain text with specific enhancements for dealing with emails.
Finally, I've put a decent amount of work into my [vim-xcode] plugin, which is
my attempt to escape the confines of Xcode in favor of Vim when doing iOS
development.

I root for the [Houston Astros][astros], and lift heavy weights at [CrossFit
South Lamar][cf-sola]
