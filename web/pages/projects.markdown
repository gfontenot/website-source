I love open source code, and have been lucky enough to be given the
opportunity to work on some amazing projects.

- [Runes] - Swift - Infix operators for monadic functions
- [Argo] - Swift - Functional JSON parsing
- [Curry] - Swift - Implementations for function currying any function with a
  reasonable number of arguments
- [Liftoff] - Ruby - Command line client for generating and configuring Xcode
  projects

I try to do as much as possible in the open. That means you can likely watch
me work in real time [on GitHub][github]
